This code implements a simple 2D maze game using the Pygame library. Here's a breakdown of what the code does and the libraries needed for it to work:

### Purpose of the Code
1. **Create a Maze**: Defines a maze using a 2D array where `1` represents a valid path and `0` represents a wall.
2. **Set Up Game Environment**:
   - Initializes Pygame, sets up the display window, and defines game settings like tile size, colors, and frames per second (FPS).
3. **Draw Maze and Player**: Functions to draw the maze and player on the screen.
4. **Move Player**: Allows the player to move through the maze using keyboard arrow keys.
5. **Main Game Loop**: Continuously updates the display, processes events, and handles player movement until the game is closed.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Libraries Needed:
- **Pygame**: Used for creating the game window, handling events, and rendering graphics.
    ```python
    import pygame
    import sys
    ```

#### Game Settings and Maze Definition:
- Defines the size of each tile and the maze layout.
    ```python
    TILE_SIZE = 50
    maze = [
        [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
        ...
        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    ]
    ROWS, COLS = len(maze), len(maze[0])
    WIDTH, HEIGHT = COLS * TILE_SIZE, ROWS * TILE_SIZE
    FPS = 60
    ```

#### Colors and Pygame Initialization:
- Defines colors and initializes Pygame.
    ```python
    WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
    BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
    RED = (255, 0, 0)
    GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
    pygame.init()
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
    pygame.display.set_caption("2D Maze Game")
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    ```

#### Player Initialization:
- Sets the player's starting position.
    ```python
    player_pos = [0, 0]
    ```

#### Functions to Draw Maze and Player:
- Draws the maze and player on the screen.
    ```python
    def draw_maze(screen, maze):
        for row in range(ROWS):
            for col in range(COLS):
                color = WHITE if maze[row][col] == 1 else BLACK
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, color, (col * TILE_SIZE, row * TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE))
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, GREEN, ((COLS-1) * TILE_SIZE, (ROWS-1) * TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE))

    def draw_player(screen, position):
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, (0, 0, 255), (position[1] * TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE / 2, position[0] * TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE / 2), TILE_SIZE / 2)
    ```

#### Function to Move the Player:
- Allows the player to move in the maze if the move is valid.
    ```python
    def move_player(maze, player_pos, direction):
        x, y = player_pos
        if direction == "up" and x > 0 and maze[x-1][y] == 1:
            player_pos[0] -= 1
        elif direction == "down" and x < ROWS - 1 and maze[x+1][y] == 1:
            player_pos[0] += 1
        elif direction == "left" and y > 0 and maze[x][y-1] == 1:
            player_pos[1] -= 1
        elif direction == "right" and y < COLS - 1 and maze[x][y+1] == 1:
            player_pos[1] += 1
    ```

#### Main Game Loop:
- Handles game events, updates the display, and processes player movements until the game is exited.
    ```python
    running = True
    while running:
        screen.fill(BLACK)
        draw_maze(screen, maze)
        draw_player(screen, player_pos)
        
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                    move_player(maze, player_pos, "up")
                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                    move_player(maze, player_pos, "down")
                elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                    move_player(maze, player_pos, "left")
                elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                    move_player(maze, player_pos, "right")
        
        pygame.display.flip()
        clock.tick(FPS)
    
    pygame.quit()
    sys.exit()
